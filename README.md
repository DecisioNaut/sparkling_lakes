P.S.: I installed spark on my local machine (MacOS) roughly following [this guide](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-get-started-with-pyspark-1adc142456ec). I must say that it was a painful experience. E.g. newest python version(s) seem not to work well with newest pyspark, so I went back to python3.8, and there were also some low level things in config-files I needed do to to get rid of warning messages (of course, you can survive without doing these things, but it tends to make me nervous).
